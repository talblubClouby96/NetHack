End of game stalls after death is reported if the persistent inventory
window is shown at the time.  Closing it manually lets the game-over
sequence proceed.  Answering 'y' to "Really quit?" and any valid response
to "Dump core?" behaves likewise.

Toggling 'perm_invent' Off with the 'O' command while the persistent
inventory window is displayed does not remove it.

Starting or restoring a game with 'perm_invent' enabled via config file
or NETHACKOPTIONS does not begin with inventory shown.

When persistent inventory window is displayed, an update that ought to
make it grow won't do so even if there is room on the screen for that.
It will add scrollbar(s) when not already there, and it can be resized
manually.
