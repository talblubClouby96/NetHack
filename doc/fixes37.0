$NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.7 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.43 $ $NHDT-Date: 1578137629 2020/01/04 11:33:49 $

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
hero polymorphed into a vampire can use #monster to shape-shift rather than
	just do a one-shot polymorph into bat/cloud/wolf and shifted vampire
	hero can use #monster again to take on another form (randomly chosen
	among the shiftable shapes and true vampire form)
adjust bones filename buffer sizes to accommodate suffix
fix internal self-recover to work with recent fields added to checkpoint file
improvements to pronoun usage when hallucinating
function calls made from mapglyph based on dungeon level are now called once
	per level
fix accessing mons[-1] when trying to gate in a non-valid demon
fast hero could have random clairvoyance happen more than once on same turn
using 'Q' on wielded weapon would offer to split stack; make using 'w' on a
	quivered stack behave similarly
weight for giant spider was too low for creature of size 'large';
	weight for giant beetle was much too low for 'large'
leave some menu items out of "invert all" via '@' when their inclusion would
	degrade the usefulness of that interface feature
change crysknife from mineral to bone and worm tooth from unspecified to bone
worn meat ring shouldn't cause increased hunger; neither should fake Amulet
worn +0 ring of protection should cause increased hunger if it is the only
	source of extrinsic Protection
fix accessing mons[-1] when monster figures out if a tin cures stoning
monster wielding Stormbringer or healer's Staff against another monster would
	heal the hero instead of the wielding monster when draining life
change twoweapon feedback from "not a weapon" to "not a suitable weapon"


Fixes to 3.7.0-x Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
fix compile when DLB isn't defined
urealtime.realtime was being incorrectly calculated
revised "mysterious force" when climbing out of gehennom could generate
	warnings about "rn2(0) attempted" or "rn2(-n) attempted"
after 'w' on split stack patch, wielding '-' would cause an object_lost panic
same patch allowed partial stack from getobj to replace cursed wielded weapon
if the orc-town version of mine town has been loaded, creation of orc zombies
	or orc mummies would name them as part of the town raiding orc clan


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------


General New Features
--------------------
if a killer bee encounters a lump of royal jelly and there is no queen bee on
	the level, the bee will eat the jelly and become a new queen
automatic annotation "gateway to Moloch's Sanctum" for vibrating square level
	once that square's location becomes known (found or magic mapped);
	goes away once sanctum temple is found (entered or high altar mapped)
savefile: add support to deconstruct internal data structures down into their
	individual fields and save those fields instead of the entire struct
savefile: use little-endian format for fields where that makes a difference
replace build-time level compiler and dungeon compiler with run-time loading of
	the dungeon and level descriptions and interpreting them via LUA
split off some of the functionality that was in makedefs (compiled-in options
	build date/time, etc) so that it can be built by a cross-compiler
	and accessed on the target platform
replace quest.txt and associated conversion to quest.dat via makedefs with
	lua quest texts loaded at runtime
some altars are displayed in different colors (for tty and curses at least)
add 'quick_farsight' option to provide some control over random clairvoyance
	where pausing to be able to browse temporarily visible aspects of the
	revealed map can seem intrusive; doesn't affect clairvoyance spell
replace "money" in in-game texts with "gold"
