General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
fix compile when DLB isn't defined
hero polymorphed into a vampire can use #monster to shape-shift rather than
	just do a one-shot polymorph into bat/cloud/wolf and shifted vampire
	hero can use #monster again to take on another form (randomly chosen
	among the shiftable shapes and true vampire form)
adjust bones filename buffer sizes to accommodate suffix
fix internal self-recover to work with recent fields added to checkpoint file

General New Features
--------------------
if a killer bee encounters a lump of royal jelly and there is no queen bee on
	the level, the bee will eat the jelly and become a new queen
automatic annotation "gateway to Moloch's Sanctum" for vibrating square level
	once that square's location becomes known (found or magic mapped);
	goes away once sanctum temple is found (entered or high altar mapped)
savefile: add support to deconstruct internal data structures down into their
	individual fields and save those fields instead of the entire struct
savefile: use little-endian format for fields where that makes a difference
replace build-time level compiler and dungeon compiler with run-time loading of
	the dungeon and level descriptions and interpreting them via LUA
